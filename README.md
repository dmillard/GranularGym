# GranularGym

High performance simulation for robotic tasks with granular materials.
GranularGym can reach realtime simulation of hundreds of thousands of particles
interacting (one-way) with rigid bodies of arbitrary geometry.

**Note (9 June 2023): Currently this repository contains the core engine code,
examples are being cleaned and will be released soon.**
