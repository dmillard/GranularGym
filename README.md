# GranularGym

High performance simulation for robotic tasks with granular materials.
GranularGym can reach realtime simulation of hundreds of thousands of particles
interacting (one-way) with rigid bodies of arbitrary geometry.

This repository contains the core engine code, example usages are given in the
referenced paper below.
